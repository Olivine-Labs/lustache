furq's excellent refactoring notes:

* lustache.render() becomes lustache:render() and so forth
* Context() becomes require("context"):new() and so forth
* RenderFunctionsWithArgsTest fails atm, tags are a bit of a mess
* probably not all of the functions each module exposes need to be exposed
* specs need to be run with busted_bootstrap for relative paths in package.path to work
* code itself hasn't been touched, comments marked with --> are "suggestions"
* ^ except line 83-84 in renderer.lua to fix a bug
